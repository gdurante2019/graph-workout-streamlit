# Code for producing summary graph of Zwift rides
This repo houses code for a function that takes in a fitfile and returns a graph with a similar color scheme to Zwift workout summary graphs.

## Purpose
The inspiration for this project comes from discussions with fellow Zwift enthusiasts who race in the Zwift Racing League on the Backpedal (BAKPDL) team and would like to share their workout summary graphs from Zwift rides in a simple, standardized way in chat discussions.  Note:  these graphs are created from fitfiles, not Zwift, and no Zwift branding is implied or endorsed.  The graphs are meant simply to provide riders in our group to be able to quickly compare workouts on Zwift, in case they did not take a screenshot of the ride summary graph at the end of their rides.

## To use:
Users will upload workout fitfiles and enter their FTP. Optionally, users who want to have their name and/or profile pictures displayed on the graph, they can upload a picture and type in their name.

## Coming soon:
I'm working on deploying this code using Streamlit to allow everyone to generate a workout graph easily from a simple interface.
